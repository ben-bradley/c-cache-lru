/**
 * Basic cluster example for @ben-bradley/c-cache-lru.
 *
 * Same shape as c-cache's basic-cluster demo, but the data store is
 * LruStorage (backed by lru-cache) instead of the default MapStorage.
 *
 * Run from this package root after building both packages:
 *   npm run build
 *   node examples/basic-cluster.mjs
 *
 * Important: createCache() must run on the primary as well as on workers.
 * On the primary it registers the data store and installs IPC handlers.
 * On workers it proxies operations to the primary over cluster IPC.
